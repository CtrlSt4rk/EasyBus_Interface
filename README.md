# EasyBus_Interface 

Simple Flutter/dart interface that's used as a basis for a bus ticket app that can add cash to the individual account and purchase tickets directly into a bus using a QR code. 

The file 'LiveSql_EasyBus.sql' contains the SQL code for the basic database functions of the app.

If the code doesn't work properly, try creating a new dart project and copying the assets and lib folders to it, it should work properly.
